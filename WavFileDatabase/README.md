# WavFileDatabase
database of wavfiles with direction of arrival and speech signals

I used the Onyx Blackbird Premium Recording Interface to record stereo wav files which have been split in each data file. 
I am speaking in a general direction, as well as saying something in English (information stated in the txt document of each file). 
This database is for those who are trying to recognize the direction of arrival and recognize several speech sourcess (namely, me!). 

I hope that is a help to anyone implementing new algorithms in acoustics and sound source localization.
